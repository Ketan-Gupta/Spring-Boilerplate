Annotation Based Configuration using Configuration Class and not XML File
---
1. The Application Context is loaded using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.
2. Instead of using XML File, we use a special dedicated class defined to list the configuration.
3. The file is suffixed with @Configuration.
4. The configuration class contains individual method that will return the newly created object of the bean.
5. Those individual methods are annotated with @Bean to specify that they will be returning a bean. 
6. @Autowired by default always checks the type of bean that is being returned.
7. Hence, for all the bean annotated methods written in configuration class, the name of method is of no relevance,
what's important is the return type of that method, which is what is checked by the @Autowired annotation when it goes to 
search inside the configuration class.
